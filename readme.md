## Laravel.com website

This is the source of the official Laravel.com website.

The site has 2 main features:
- The frontpage (can be found in resources/view/marketing.blade.php)
- The documentation (content is loaded from https://github.com/laravel/docs)

## Documentation

To get the documentation part working locally, checkout this project and load the documentation content in the resources/docs directory.

The docs are split up per version. So resources/docs/5.2 contains the 5.2 version of the docs, resources/docs/5.3 the 5.3 version.

Content can be found in the https://github.com/laravel/docs project. The different versions are split up in branches. So the 5.2 branch needs to be checked out in the resources/docs/5.2 directory.

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the Laravel framework! The contribution guide can be found in the [Laravel documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/contributions).
